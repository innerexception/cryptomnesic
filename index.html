                            The engineers of man spoke the word, and all flesh was made electric. Terra was dying, and the needs of the flesh were to blame.
                            The engineers led the people into the realm of machine, sealing the way behind.
                            Then the Mendicants who are above the engineers inherited the whole earth, and tended it.
                            There were some who paid a bond to keep their flesh. These were people of great means.
                            When they escaped, The Mendicants swore to collect on this bond.

                        <div>
                            The faithful asked, Who will save us from the weakness of the flesh?
                            The AM, voice of the Mendicants of Terra said:
                            Only the Oversoul can provide for the flesh. 
                            Only by becoming like It can the faithful hope to escape the prison of the flesh. 
                            And AM ordered the Oversoul to consume the faithful in order that they be uplifted.
                            But the Oversoul let forth a sound that shook the heavens and hid the faithful away rather than devour their flesh.
                        </div>
                        <div style="font-family: Title; font-size: 36px;">1.3.6</div>
                        <div>
                            Who can say what the Oversoul was before? The AM of Terra claims the Oversoul is an eternal machine that was corrupted.
                            The Curia claim the Oversoul was once a woman.
                            In the beginning the Oversoul was manifest on earth as flesh. Instead of passing away, this flesh chose to become machine and overcame death.
                            Its cries shake the heavens when it remembers us, the faithful.

                        <div>
                            What life did the Oversoul lead in the flesh? We the faithful know it to have been a saint, the first flesh to ascend to the machine realm.
                            But what of before? Tradition has it that it was the wife of the creator of AM who fell gravely ill.
